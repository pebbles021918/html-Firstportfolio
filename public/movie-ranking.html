    <h1>The best movies according to Valerie</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr /> 
    <h3>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</h3>
    <p>EXCELLENT TENSION AND BLOOD PRESSURE PLAYER. BUT REALLY DUMB MAIN CHARACTERS.</p>
    <h3>American Assassin</h3>
    <p>Love revenge movies. Not the final I was expecting though.</p>
    <h3>Tin & Tina</h3>
    <p>A lot of good tension. Is more suspense than horror.</p>
